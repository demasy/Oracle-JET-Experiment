# JavaScript Extension Toolkit (Oracle JET)

**Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET)** empowers developers by providing a modular open-source toolkit based on modern JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS3, and HTML5 design and development principles. 

**Oracle JET** is targeted at JavaScript developers working on client-side applications. It's a collection of open-source JavaScript libraries (**Preact** or **Knockout-based** architectures) along with a set of Oracle-contributed JavaScript libraries that make it as simple and efficient as possible to build applications that consume and interact with Oracle products and services, especially Oracle Cloud services.
